* MEMO.
  I'll be breaking this out into categories.

** Arch-based TODOs
   Arch stands for "Architecture" btw. I don't have ANY faith in myself spelling that right :P

   - [ ] /**A user first interface**/ I'm the core maintainer of this project. I just wanted a super good interface for editing. Edit with ease and without mental strain. `leap.nvim` is a great plugin for that!

   - [ ] /**Customize EVERYTHING**/ I want end-users to have the ability to customize EVERYTHING. (First seat support). Although, this is my personal configuration. :P

** âš¡ Speed related TODO
   I have a quite old machine so, speed matters alot to me.
   But:
   - Lua is single threaded.
   - Using external libraries usually hurts performance than help.
   - Also using external libraries requires other users that may or may not be interested need to install it.
   - Better performance may come at a cost of customization.
   - I've tried caching but it's too difficult or slow.
   - Tradeoffs of performance and features are difficult for me to decide.

   I've tried:
   - Writing it in Rust
   - Implementing async
   - Rewritting (AKA "borrowing" code) the module finder
   - Build nvim builds with `-Ofast`

   What worked:
   - Building nvim with `-Ofast`, but I don't remember how I did it.
   - Implementing "async" on some degree.
