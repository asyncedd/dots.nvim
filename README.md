## 👋 Introduction

This is my personal Neovim configuration as, I said. In the configuration I
prioritize the editing experience rather than speed and making it simple.
Really, the thing that matters for Neovim configs are:

- The overall editing experience

Not gonna lie, startup time doesn't really matter for Neovim configurations.
It's about the overall editing experience of the editor. Copy-pasting
stuff from this should be super easy, no nonsense spaggehti code and whatsoever.

It had optimized my workspace and, improve my productivity.

_Q 🙋 Why should I use this?_

> A: Don't. Do-not. Please don't. For the love of god. If you just use someone
> else's config, you're not really gonna boost your productivity. Just use this
> to steal configs and the file tree, I don't mind :)

## Wow, a really good place to put: ⚠️ DISCLAIMER! ⚠️

> Here's some DISCLAIMERS!

- If want to exit Neovim, just plug out your computer (or for laptop users...
  >:) You don't want to). I meant, that'll never work.
- Auto-installing parsers via `auto_install = true` will send out a bunch of errors. Check: [this](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter/issues/4250)

## 🤨 Crash course: Installing

Dependencies:

- `nvim` :)
- `fzf` for Telescope!
- `fd` for Telescope too!
- `sqlite3` for sqlite.lua

Other Dependencies:

`:checkhealth`
`:checkhealth mason`

To install this configuration, you need a Neovim build. You can use your
favorite package manager or,
[Install from source](https://dev.to/asyncedd/building-neovim-from-source-1794).
Then clone this repository.

# For *Nix (Linux/MacOS) systems:

```bash
mkdir ~/.config/nvim/
git clone https://github.com/asycnedd/nvim.git ~/.config/nvim/
nvim --headless "+Lazy! sync" +qa
```
# For Windows systems:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/asyncedd/nvim.git ~/AppData/Local/nvim/
nvim --headless "+Lazy! sync" +qa
```

Then it should bootstrap [lazy.nvim 💤](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim).
Then you can get a cup of [mocha ☕](https://github.com/catppuccin/nvim) while
you wait. (Not that long btw) Then once it finished, you're done! (actually)
Just run a `nvim` in your terminal :D

# 🚶 After

Go to TabNineHub or something and, turn code completion to CLOUD. Not Hybird nor local. Otherwise, you'll have severe performance issues! (on my machine)

## ⚡ Performance

TODO Redo it once ~~I get it to be more faster (troll)~~ Unlazy
This is really outdated btw.

Check [this](https://github.com/asyncedd/dots.nvim/tree/master/profiles)
Specs:
- Intel i7-6500U
- Bloated Arco Linux install.
- 16GB DDR3 RAM.
- Old SSD.

~~As you can see, my Neovim configuration is FASTER than `nvim --clean`. This is
because, I disabled unneeded RTP (runtime plugins) which took `125ms+`. That's
1.2 seconds! In my case, I have **24** plugins. I lazy loaded them so, it's
blazingly fast!~~ As I've been adding more plugins (LSP, Completion etc...) It's
a bit slower now. But it's quite fast though!

## 😰 Quitting Nvim.

You're stuck here forever! Muahahahah! You fell RIGHT into my trap! There's no
way out! >:D
